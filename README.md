# carpooling_app

It is my Final Year Project. I worked as both Frontend and Backend side.

## Vision Statement

It is an application for car owners to post rides who want to share their rides, and passengers can request to join their rides. Carpooling is an android application developed using flutter and firebase that will help driver to post-ride and passenger to send a request for that ride. The ride-sharing system intends to minimize fuel usage and reduce traffic jams. Also, by such a system, we will reduce the travelling expenses of users. Unlike other systems (Careem), only passengers can share the ride and share the expense. On the other hand, our product (Carpooling Application) tends to profit both driver and passenger by reducing both driver and passenger travelling costs.

## Problem Statement
Pakistan is a developing country. Currently, it is facing many challenges. Pollution, high traffic jams, loss of revenue to purchase oil, high prices of automobiles, a smaller number of public transport services, few parking spaces and low wages are a few but critical challenges Pakistan is facing today. A few apps like cream have resolved issues, but there is still a gap for improvement.

## Problem Solution
If we put a maximum of people in a single car, we resolve such problems. It also provides an additional benefit to both the car owner and passengers in the sense that they both save their money and also their social circle increases. Furthermore, our app ensures a person's identity by conforming his/her profile, so in case of any mishap, we could provide a complete detail to the police along with their location. Our app offers a trusted platform where anyone can share his car with a  minimal effort.
